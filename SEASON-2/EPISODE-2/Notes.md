## Promises :

**`A Promise is an object representing the eventual(finally or in the course of time, or later) completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.`**

**`Essentially, promise is a returned object to which you can attach callbacks, instead of passing the callbacks into a function`**

**`A Promise is used to handle asynchronous operations, which are some tasks that may take some time to complete, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file.`**

`By creating a promise, you are essentially telling the JavaScript engine to "promise" to perform a specific action and notify you once it is completed or fails. The code either executes or fails , in both the cases subscriber will be notified.`

`Next, callback functions are then attached to the promise to handle the outcome of the action. These callbacks will be invoked when the promise is fulfilled (action completed successfully) or rejected (action failed).`

We will discuss with code example that how things used to work before Promises and then how it works after Promises

Suppose, taking an example of E-Commerce

```js
const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

// Below two functions are asynchronous and dependent on each other
const orderId = createOrder(cart);
proceedToPayment(orderId);

// with Callback (Before Promise)
// Below here, it is the responsibility of createOrder function to first create the order then call the callback function
createOrder(cart, function () {
    proceedToPayment(orderId);
});
// Above there is the issue of `Inversion of Control`
```

Q: How to fix the above issue?
A: We can fix this issue using **Promise.**

-   Now, we will make **createOrder function** return a promise and we will capture that promise into a variable.

    ```js
    const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

    const promise = createOrder(cart);
    ```

-   Promise is nothing but we can assume it to be empty object with some data value in it, and this data value will hold whatever this **createOrder function** will return.

-   Since **createOrder function** is an async function and we don't know how much time will it take to finish execution.

-   So the moment **createOrder** will get executed, it will return you a **undefined value.** Let's say after 5 secs execution finished, so now orderId is ready and it will fill the undefined value with the orderId.

-   In short, When createOrder get executed, it immediately returns a promise object with undefined value.

    `{data: undefined}`
    `Initially it will be undefined`

-   Then javascript will continue to execute with other lines of code.

-   After sometime when createOrder has finished execution and orderId is ready then that will **automatically** be assigned to our returned promise which was earlier undefined.

    `So it looks like : {data: orderDetails}`

-   So after getting the data, the question is how we will get to know **response** is ready?
    **Ans:** So, we will attach a **callback function** to the **promise** object using `.then` to get triggered **automatically** when result is ready.

    ```js
    promise.then(function (orderId) {
        proceedToPayment(orderId);
    });
    ```

-   So after all the steps, the full code looks like :

    ```js
    const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

    const promise = createOrder(cart);

    promise.then(function (orderId) {
        proceedToPayment(orderId);
    });
    ```

Q: How it is better than callback approach?

-   In Earlier solution we used to pass the function and then used to trust the function to execute the callback.

-   But with promise, we are attaching a callback function to a promise Object.

-   that means **`Essentially, promise is a returned object to which you can attach callbacks, instead of passing the callbacks into a function`**

-   There is difference between these words, passing a function and attaching a function.

-   Promise guarantee, it will callback the attached function once it has the fulfilled data. And it will call it only once. Just once.

-   Earlier we talked about promise are object with empty data but that's not entirely true, Promise are much more than that.

### Another `Callback Hell` Example and how `promise` is used to avoid callback hell :

```js
createOrder(cart, function (orderId) {
    proceedToPayment(orderId, function (paymentInf) {
        showOrderSummary(paymentInf, function (balance) {
            updateWalletBalance(balance);
        });
    });
});
// And now above code is expanding horizontally and this is called pyramid of doom.
// Callback hell is ugly and hard to maintain.
```

-   Promise fixes this issue too using `Promise Chaining` :

    `Promise Chaining` :

    ```js
    createOrder(cart)
        .then(function (orderId) {
            proceedToPayment(orderId);
        })
        .then(function (paymentInf) {
            showOrderSummary(paymentInf);
        })
        .then(function (balance) {
            updateWalletBalance(balance);
        });
    ```

‚ö†Ô∏è Common PitFall

-   We forget to return promise in Promise Chaining
-   The idea is promise/data returned from one `.then` become data for next `.then`
    So,

```js
createOrder(cart)
    .then(function (orderId) {
        return proceedToPayment(orderId);
    })
    .then(function (paymentInf) {
        return showOrderSummary(paymentInf);
    })
    .then(function (balance) {
        return updateWalletBalance(balance);
    });
```

-   To improve readability you can use arrow function instead of regular function

**Now let's understand and see a real promise object.**

-   fetch is a web-api which is utilized to make api call and it returns a promise.

-   We will be calling public github api to fetch data https://api.github.com/users/alok722

```js
// We will be calling public github api to fetch data
const URL = "https://api.github.com/users/alok722";
const user = fetch(URL);
// User above will be a promise and once the line finished the execution the fetch returns the promise.and at that particular time promise is in the pending state.
// But JavaScript does not wait for anything so, it just quickly goes to the next line and logs the user which is in pending state.
console.log(user); // Promise {<Pending>}
// But what is google chrome does is , after some point of time the data comes into the "user promise object".
// so if you expand the promise which shows pending in the console then it will show you the current state of the promise and you will see that it will be fullfilled.
```

### OBSERVATIONS OF THE ABOVE CODE:

-   If we will deep dive and see, this `promise` object has 3 things

-   `prototype`, `promiseState` & `promiseResult`

-   & this `promiseResult` is the same data which we talked earlier as data.

-   & initially `promiseResult` is `undefined`

-   `promiseResult` will store data returned from API call

-   `promiseState` will tell in which state the promise is currently, initially it will be in `pending` state and later it will become `fulfilled`

-   When above line is executed, `fetch` makes API call and return a `promise` instantly which is in `Pending` state and Javascript doesn't wait to get it `fulfilled`

-   And in next line it console out the `pending promise`.

-   NOTE: chrome browser has some in-consistency, the moment console happens it shows in pending state but if you will expand that it will show fulfilled because chrome updated the log when promise get fulfilled.

-   Once fulfilled data is there in promiseResult and it is inside body in ReadableStream format and there is a way to extract data.

*   Now after getting the data we can attach callback to above response?

**Using .then**

```js
const URL = "https://api.github.com/users/alok722";
const user = fetch(URL);

user.then(function (data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

-   And this is how Promise is used.
-   It guarantees that it could be resolved only once, either it could be `success` or `failure`

-   A Promise is in one of these states:

    -   **pending:** initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    -   **fulfilled:** meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    -   **rejected:** meaning that the operation failed.

üí°Promise Object are immutable.
-> Once promise is **fulfilled** and we have data we can pass here and there and we don't have to worry that someone can mutate that data. So over above we can't directly mutate user promise object, we will have to use **.then**

### `Interview Guide :`

üí°What is Promise?

-> **Promise object is a placeholder for certain period of time until we receive value from asynchronous operation.**

-> **A container for a future value.**

`Recommended Defination :`
-> **A Promise is an object representing the eventual(finally or in the course of time, or later) completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.**

-> So here `Eventual` from the above line refers to `something that will happen at some point in the future, but the exact timing may not be specified or immediate.`

We are now done solving one issue of callback i.e. Inversion of Control

But there is one more issue, callback hell...

```js
// Callback Hell Example
createOrder(cart, function (orderId) {
    proceedToPayment(orderId, function (paymentInf) {
        showOrderSummary(paymentInf, function (balance) {
            updateWalletBalance(balance);
        });
    });
});
// And now above code is expanding horizontally and this is called pyramid of doom.
// Callback hell is ugly and hard to maintain.

// üí° Promise fixes this issue too using `Promise Chaining`
// Example Below is a Promise Chaining
createOrder(cart)
    .then(function (orderId) {
        proceedToPayment(orderId);
    })
    .then(function (paymentInf) {
        showOrderSummary(paymentInf);
    })
    .then(function (balance) {
        updateWalletBalance(balance);
    });

// ‚ö†Ô∏è Common PitFall
// We forget to return promise in Promise Chaining
// The idea is promise/data returned from one .then become data for next .then
// So,
createOrder(cart)
    .then(function (orderId) {
        return proceedToPayment(orderId);
    })
    .then(function (paymentInf) {
        return showOrderSummary(paymentInf);
    })
    .then(function (balance) {
        return updateWalletBalance(balance);
    });

// To improve readability you can use arrow function instead of regular function
```
