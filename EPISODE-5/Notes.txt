undefined vs not defined in JS :

1. In first phase (memory allocation) JS assigns each variable a placeholder called undefined.

2. undefined is when memory is allocated for the variable, but no value is assigned yet.

3. If an object/variable is not even declared/found in memory allocation phase, and tried to access it then it is Not defined

Not Defined !== Undefined

4. When variable is declared but not assigned value, its current value is undefined. But when the variable itself is not declared but called in code, then it is not defined.

5. JS is a loosely typed / weakly typed language. It doesn't attach variables to any datatype. We can say var a = 5, and then change the value to boolean a = true or string a = 'hello' later on.

6. Never assign undefined to a variable manually. Let it happen on it's own accord.
