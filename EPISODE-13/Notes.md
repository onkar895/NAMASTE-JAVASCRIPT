## First Class Functions ft. Anonymous Functions :

Functions are heart â™¥ of Javascript.

### Q: What is Anonymous Function?

-   A function without a name is called Anonymous Function.

```js
function () {

}// this is going to throw Syntax Error - Function Statement requires function name.
```

-   They don't have their own identity. So an anonymous function without code inside it results in an error.
-   Anonymous functions are used when functions are used as values eg. the code sample for function expression above.

### Q: What is Function statement?

```js
function a() {
    console.log("Hello");
}
a(); // Hello
-   This way of creating functions are called function statement.
```

### Q: What is Function Expression?

-   Assigning a function to a variable. Function acts like a value.

```js
var b = function () {
    console.log("Hello");
};
b();
```

### Q: Difference between function statement and expression

-   The major difference between these two lies in Hoisting.

```js
a(); // "Hello A"
b(); // TypeError
function a() {
    console.log("Hello A");
}
var b = function () {
    console.log("Hello B");
};
// Why? During mem creation phase a is created in memory and function assigned to a. But b is created like a variable (b:undefined) and until code reaches the function()  part, it is still undefined. So it cannot be called.
```

### Q: What is Function Declaration?

-   Other name for function statement.
