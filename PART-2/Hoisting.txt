Hoisting in JavaScript ðŸ”¥(variables & functions) : 

    1. In JavaScript,Hoisting is a default behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration. 
    2. Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local. 
    3. It allows us to call functions before even writing them in our code. 
    4. JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
